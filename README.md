This is intended to simplify and streamline common repetative configuration tasks that I find myself doing when I spin up a local vm for dev, interviews, or whatever

1. spin up a machine, making sure that you have added an existing public ssh key to that machine's users .ssh/authorized keys and the private to your ssh keys.
2. setup larger ansible folder and copy this roles folder into it
3. run your playbooks
4. Grab a cup of coffee
